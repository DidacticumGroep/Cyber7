## üìç Overview

The project is focused on provisioning resources in Azure and deploying various applications, such as an ARM template for schedule requests and HashiCorp Vault on an Azure Kubernetes Cluster. It allows for customization and flexibility through the use of variables and providers in Terraform. The purpose of the project is to streamline the process of resource provisioning and deployment, improving efficiency and making it easier to manage and secure applications. Its value proposition lies in simplifying the setup and management of Azure and Kubernetes resources, as well as providing a secure solution for storing and managing secrets.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

| Feature                | Description                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **‚öôÔ∏è Architecture**     | The codebase follows a modular architecture, with separate files for each feature or functionality. It utilizes Terraform for provisioning Azure resources and deploying applications on a Kubernetes cluster. The main.tf files handle provisioning, while the provider.tf files configure providers, and the variables.tf files set up customizable parameters. The codebase also includes a .dccache file to manage a secret file and a .dcignore file to specify files and directories to be ignored. |
| **üìñ Documentation**   | The codebase lacks comprehensive documentation. While there are inline comments explaining the purpose of each file, there is room for improvement in terms of high-level system documentation, architectural diagrams, and explanation of design decisions. Developers working on the codebase would benefit from additional documentation. |
| **üîó Dependencies**    | The codebase relies on external libraries such as Azure Resource Manager and Azure Active Directory for provisioning and managing Azure resources. It also utilizes Hashicorp Vault and Helm for deploying Vault on the Kubernetes

## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions are always welcome! Please follow these steps:
1. Fork the project repository. This creates a copy of the project on your account that you can modify without affecting the original project.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine using a Git client like Git or GitHub Desktop.
3. Create a new branch with a descriptive name (e.g., `new-feature-branch` or `bugfix-issue-123`).
```sh
git checkout -b new-feature-branch
```
4. Make changes to the project's codebase.
5. Commit your changes to your local branch with a clear commit message that explains the changes you've made.
```sh
git commit -m 'Implemented new feature.'
```
6. Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub using the following command
```sh
git push origin new-feature-branch
```
7. Create a new pull request to the original project repository. In the pull request, describe the changes you've made and why they're necessary.
The project maintainers will review your changes and provide feedback or merge them into the main branch.
